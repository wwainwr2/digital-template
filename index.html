<h2>Cyber Surfing</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is Cyber Surfing, try to collect all the bits of data 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
There should be a determined experience when people play this game. You only get one life so that should
get a faster and intenser feel when you play. Also the game is based around collecting a large amount of 
items so you want to get as many as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
arcade collector 
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The base mechanics of Cyber Surfing is moving. You want to collect as many of the data bits as possible.
Once you collect one another will appear somewhere else on the board.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
this prototype is evaluating the movement mechanics and the random placement of items
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think the theme sets my game apart from the rest. Anyone can have an arcade game that collects items
but changing the theme to cyber space gives it a different edge.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Theres basically two main characters and 1 generic character. They main characters are you who is the agent inside the
mini bot and the president who you are inside of trying to save. I think this setting is different and hopefully thats a 
good thing. The generic character is the enemies inside the other ships who are trying to kill you.
The game world is unique becauase its not in space or on a planet but inside a human being.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story is that you need to find the location of the terrosit group before they go out with their plans
to destroy the city. You must collect data in cyber space and put the pieces together. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic is honestly anyone that appeals to arcade games/ collecting
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
until i put in a timer/enemies it can be played forever
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
if you play for a set amount of time the best strategy is to keep towards the middle when you pick up a objective
because the next one will spawn at random so being close to the middle is equal distant from each side.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed some from the example assets on the phaser site and others on devinart and some made myself I also used
one from the sprite database
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most represents the generic platformer type example from phaser but i made it so theres no gravity
and you can move in any direction.
