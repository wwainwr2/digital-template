<h2>Infection Annihilation</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is Infection Annihilation a shooter where you destroy infectious robots in a body
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
There should be a determined experience when people play this game. You only get one life so that should
get a faster and intenser feel when you play. Also the game is based around saving someones life so if you
immerse yourself you can feel a sense of releif if you make it or sad if you lose and the body dies.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
arcade shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The base mechanics to Infection Annihilation is shooting and moving. You want to destroy the enemy mini bots that are inside this body
to do that you must shoot them while moving to dodge their fire. You use the arrow keys to move left and right since there is no action to move
up and back(as of yet). That would add a compeltely new addition to the game if that were to happen. You get a score depending on how much of the
body you end up saving so you wanna destroy as many as you can so you get the best score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
this prototype is evaluating the movement mechanics and the shooting mechanics
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think the theme sets my game apart from the rest. Anyone can have an arcade shooter but an arcade shooter that is basically
inside a person and using not spaceships but mini bots.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Theres basically two main characters and 1 generic character. They main characters are you who is the agent inside the
mini bot and the president who you are inside of trying to save. I think this setting is different and hopefully thats a 
good thing. The generic character is the enemies inside the other ships who are trying to kill you.
The game world is unique becauase its not in space or on a planet but inside a human being.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The war rages on between all the countries on earth and after a assassination attempt on the US President by a russian assassin
the president has been infected with a syringe full of not a virus or poison but hundreds of nanobot ships with pilots shooting
small electric charges. They are going for the presidents heart and trying to shock it into cardiac arrest. You have been chosen
to go in and stop them from reaching the heart at any cost. The president was injected in the calf so the scientists have cut off
blood flow to slow them down and are going to shrink you down so you can man the SCOOTY PUFF JUNIOR and inject you straight into
his chest. This ship has the firepower to destroy any enemy ship but is also fragile itself so one hit and you are done. Gods Speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic is honestly anyone that appeals to arcade shooters and or secret missions
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1-2 mins tops
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
until i implement the movement of up and back as well as left to right the only strategy is to dodge left and right and inbetween dodges shoot the enemy
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed some from the example assets on the phaser site and others on devinart and some made myself
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most represents the invaders example on phaser. I used the same framework for enemy movement but changed assets
and lives system, etc.
